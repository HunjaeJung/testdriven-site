<p><em>Learn how to build, test, and deploy microservices powered by Docker, Flask, and React!</em></p>

<p>In this course, you will learn how to quickly spin up a reproducible development environment with Docker to manage a number of microservices. Once the app is up and running locally, you'll learn how to deploy it to an Amazon EC2 instance. Finally, we'll look at scaling the services on Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS).</p>

<p>"Code without tests is broken by design." - Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p>
