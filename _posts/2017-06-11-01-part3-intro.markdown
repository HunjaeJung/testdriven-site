In Part 3, we'll add database migrations along with password hashing in order to implement token-based authentication to the users service with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

#### Objectives

By the end of part 3, you should be able to...

1. Use Flask Migration to handle database migrations
1. Configure Flask Bcrypt for password hashing
1. Implement user authentication with JWTs
1. Write tests to create and verify JWTs and user authentication
1. Discuss the benefits of using JWTs versus sessions and cookies for authentication
1. Log errors as necessary
1. Configure Swagger to interact with a service
