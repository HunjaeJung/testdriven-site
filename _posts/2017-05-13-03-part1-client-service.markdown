Instead of just serving up JSON, let's spice it up with some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript...

---

Add a new folder to "services" called "web" to house the web service. Next, navigate to the new folder, and add a quick Flask app that serves up a base HTML file and some static files:

```sh
$ mkdir templates && mkdir static
$ touch templates/index.html && touch static/main.js && \
touch static/main.css && touch app.py
```

Update *app.py*:

```python
foobarbaz
```

Coming soon..
