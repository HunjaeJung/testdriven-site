In Part 2, we'll split the project into three distinct projects. We'll also add *code coverage* and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) to each repo to ensure that each service can be ran and tested independently from the whole. Finally, we'll add *ReactJS* to the client-side.

*Structure*:

1. flask-microservices-main - Docker Compose files, Nginx, admin scripts
1. flask-microservices-users - Flask app
1. flask-microservices-client - client-side

Coming soon!
