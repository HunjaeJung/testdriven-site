What are we building?

---

By the end of this course, you will have built a code evaluation tool for grading code exercises, similar to Codecademy, with Python, Flask, JavaScript, and ReactJS. The app, itself, will allow a user to log in and submit solutions to a coding problem. They will also be able to get feedback on whether a particular solution is correct or not.

Final app:

We'll use the [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/) pattern as we develop and design each microservice.

Along with twelve-factor, we'll also practice test-driven development (TDD), writing tests first when it makes sense to do so. The focus will be on server-side unit, functional, and integration tests, client-side unit tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the entire system works as expected.

Finally, we'll dive into Docker and container orchestration to help manage, scale, and deploy our fleet of microservices.
