In part 2, we'll add *code coverage* and *continuous integration* testing to ensure that each service can be run and tested independently from the whole. Finally, we'll add *ReactJS* along with *Jest*, a JavaScript test runner, and *Enzyme*, a testing library made specifically for React, to the client-side.

## Structure

Before diving in, take a quick look at the current project structure:

```sh
├── docker-compose-dev.yml
├── docker-compose-prod.yml
└── services
    ├── nginx
    │   ├── Dockerfile
    │   └── flask.conf
    └── users
        ├── Dockerfile-dev
        ├── Dockerfile-prod
        ├── entrypoint-prod.sh
        ├── entrypoint.sh
        ├── manage.py
        ├── project
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── api
        │   │   ├── __init__.py
        │   │   ├── models.py
        │   │   ├── templates
        │   │   │   └── index.html
        │   │   └── users.py
        │   ├── config.py
        │   ├── db
        │   │   ├── Dockerfile
        │   │   └── create.sql
        │   └── tests
        │       ├── __init__.py
        │       ├── base.py
        │       ├── test_config.py
        │       └── test_users.py
        └── requirements.txt
```

Notice how we are managing each microservice in a single project, with a single git repo. It's important to note that you can also break each service into a separate project, each with its own git repo. There are pros and cons to each approach - mono repo vs multiple repo. Do your research.

> Interested in the mono approach? Review the code from version 1 of this course:
> 1. [flask-microservices-main](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-microservices-main) - Docker Compose files, Nginx, admin scripts
> 1. [flask-microservices-users](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-microservices-users) - Flask app for managing users and auth
> 1. [flask-microservices-client](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-microservices-client) - client-side, React app
> 1. [flask-microservices-swagger](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-microservices-swagger) - Swagger API docs
> 1. [flask-microservices-eval](https://github.com/testdrivenio/flask-microservices-eval) - Flask app for managing user scores and exercises

## Objectives

By the end of this part, you will be able to...

1. Manage services housed in multiple git repos from a single Docker Compose file
1. Utilize a git repo as the "build context" for Docker Compose
1. Run unit and integration tests with code coverage inside a Docker Container
1. Check your code for any code quality issues via a linter
1. Work with each service independently without Docker
1. Configure Travis CI for continuous integration testing
1. Explain what React is
1. Work with React running inside a Docker Container
1. Unit test React components with Jest and Enzyme
1. Create a Single Page Application with React components
1. Use React props and state appropriately
1. Manage the state of a React component via component lifecycle methods
1. Pass environment variables to a Docker image at build time
1. Use React controlled components to handle form submissions
1. Create a production Dockerfile that uses multistage Docker builds

### App

Check out the live apps, running on EC2 -

1. [Production](http://testdriven-production-alb-1950288253.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
1. [Staging](http://testdriven-staging-alb-355212289.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com)

You can also test out the following endpoints...

| Endpoint    | HTTP Method | CRUD Method | Result          |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| /           | GET         | READ        | Load React app  |
| /users      | GET         | READ        | get all users   |
| /users/:id  | GET         | READ        | get single user |
| /users      | POST        | CREATE      | add a user      |
| /users/ping | GET         | READ        | sanity check    |

> The `/users` POST endpoint is restricted as of part 3.
