Part 1 of this tutorial covered a lot of material. We implemented token-based authentication on the server-side, queried the server for data with RESTful APIs, and used WebSocket messages (via Django Channels) to create data and send alerts to users. We also used test-driven development to plan and test our features. Parts 2 and 3 will delve into the UI programming for our app, but before we start coding the front-end, take some time to brainstorm some future enhancements:

1. Ride-sharing apps let users share their trips with other riders. How can we modify our code to attach two or more riders to the same trip?
1. Many drivers across the globe may be using our app. How can we add functionality to target nearby drivers based on the geocode location of the rider?
